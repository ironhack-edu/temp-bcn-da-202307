### Week 6: Data Analytics Lifecycle and Collaborative Project

#### Overview
Week 6 is a pivotal moment in the bootcamp, synthesizing the core concepts learned so far into a unified understanding of the data analytics  lifecycle. The week culminates in an immersive project that not only reinforces the theoretical knowledge but also emphasizes collaboration, version control with Git, and practical application of skills.

#### Topics Covered

- **Data Analytics and Data Science Lifecycle**: An exploration of the lifecycles, including defining questions, data gathering, cleaning, analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and deployment.
- **Collaborative Working**: Pair programming with collaborative tools like Git.

#### Project
- **Project Description**: You will work in pairs on a week-long project to perform descriptive statistical analysis. Using data from various sources, including datasets, web scraping, and APIs, you will extract insights and create an interactive dashboard.
- **Project Goals**:
  - **Insights Discovery**: Analyze the data to uncover compelling insights.
  - **Visualization**: Create visualizations that tell a story and facilitate decision-making.
  - **Collaboration**: Practice working collaboratively using Git and other tools.
  - **Integration**: Apply all the skills learned up to this point, from data collection to analysis and visualization.

#### Objectives
By the end of Week 6, you will have a comprehensive understanding of both the data analytics lifecycle. You will have experienced the full process of working on real-world data, from data acquisition to creating a dashboard that provides actionable insights. The collaborative nature of the project will also prepare you for teamwork in a professional environment, utilizing tools like Git for version control.

# Project #1 Guidelines
# Data Gathering, Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

*Find below the general guidelines. Please check in with your instructor to confirm their specific requirements (if they have any). Good luck!*

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to perform a descriptive statistical analysis, using data from different sources (datasets, web scraping, APIs), gain insights and create an interactive dashboard that tells a compelling story with visualizations, allowing for decision-making.

For this project, we suggest you work in pairs.

If you're struggling to come up with a topic, we suggest you take a look at [kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). However, we highly recommend that you explore and select a topic and dataset that personally interests you and your partner, as this will make the project more engaging and rewarding.

## Suggested ways to get started

1. Select a business problem and formulate one or more hypotheses that will guide your data analysis, allowing you to draw meaningful conclusions. Locate relevant data sources using methods such as web scraping, APIs, databases, or files. Consider merging multiple datasets to augment your analysis with additional insights.
1. Examine the data, understand what the fields mean and use exploratory data analysis to explore the data and identify any issues that need to be addressed.
3. Do data cleaning and data wrangling to prepare the dataset for analysis. Remember to look into missing data, outliers, data types, feature selection, converting qualitative data to quantitative etc.
3. Analyze the data, including numerical and graphical techniques to reveal patterns, relationships, and trends that may not be apparent from the raw data.
3. Create a dashboard with key KPIs and insights that tell a compelling story about the data, while allowing for decision-making.
3. Create a visually appealing presentation with minimal text to showcase that effectively communicates your insights and conclusions to stakeholders, building a compelling narrative that highlights the significance of your analysis.

Remember, the goal of this project is to showcase your skills in data analysis, visualization and extraction of insights that are meaningful and actionable.

### Guidelines to follow

- **Version control**: commit early and often, as you can always roll back to a previous version if needed. Don't be afraid of making mistakes.
- **Organizing code**: to improve the organization and readability of your code, create separate .py files for related functions, and use multiple Jupyter notebooks if necessary. Use a "main cleaning function" in *cleaning.py* (or similar) that calls all the smaller cleaning functions in a specific order to perform the entire cleaning process at once. Same for data gathering, and any other steps you find will enhace the organization of your code.

## Deliverables

You must submit the following deliverables in order for the project to be deemed complete:

- A new repo on your github account, with:
	- A **working code** that **meets all technical requirements**, **built by you**.
    - At least 1 jupyter notebook is required containing your Python code for data gathering, cleaning and preprocessing steps, descriptive statistical analysis, and visualizations. You will also provide a brief summary of the insights gained from the analysis and visualizations, along with recommendations for further analysis or actions based on the results.
    - Include your functions in .py files
  - Tableau or PowerBI report
  - Additional needed files for your work
  - A **README with the completed project documentation**.
  - The URL of the **slides for your project presentation**.
- **Presentation:**when presenting your work, there are many important factors to consider, such as the content of your presentation and the way you deliver it. The following link offers valuable advice on how to make a strong presentation: [Presentations.](https://github.com/data-bootcamp-v4/project-briefs-and-rubric/blob/main/DA%20Presentations.pdf)

### Rubrics

In order to assess your project and ensure all requirements are met, a **rubric** will be used. This rubric is used to **evaluate your project** by your teaching staff but also to **communicate** what constitutes incomplete, acceptable and excellent performance across each of the learning outcomes for the project. Take some time to review the rubric, which you can find in this repository, and ask your teacher any questions about it if necessary.

## Optional Advanced Features

While completing the basic requirements of your project is a great start, taking advantage of some advanced features can really take your work to the next level. Here are some options to consider if you want to go above and beyond, and do some research on your own:

1. Database creation:create a database to store your raw and your clean data for analysis.
1. Correlation and statistical analysis:use hypothesis testing concepts to interpret your correlation analysis and to validate your findings.
1. Improve your code by using error handling techniques, applying OOP principles for modularity and reusability, and utilizing regular expressions to extract insights from textual data.
1. Do advanced visualizations using interactive libraries such as Plotly.
1. Deploy your dashboard to the web using a tool like Flask or Django to make it accessible to others and share your insights more widely.
1. Anything outside of the box that can improve your analysis!

#### 1. Defining the Question
The first step in the data analytics process is identifying the question or problem that needs to be solved. This involves understanding the business context, objectives, and what insights are needed to make informed decisions.

#### 2. Data Gathering
Once the question is defined, the next step is to collect the necessary data. This can be done through various sources:

- **APIs**: Gathering data from external services using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
- **Web Scraping**: Extracting data from websites through automated bots.
- **Databases**: Accessing structured data stored in relational or NoSQL databases.
- **Files**: Excel, CSV or any other type of file containing data.

#### 3. Data Cleaning and Wrangling
Data often comes in raw and unstructured formats. Data cleaning and wrangling involve:

- **Cleaning**: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, outliers, correcting errors and formatting data.
- **Transforming**: Converting data into a suitable format.
- **Merging**: Combining data from different sources to create a cohesive dataset.
- And more


#### 4. Analyze the Data
This stage involves applying statistical techniques to derive insights and patterns. It may include:

- **Hypothesis Testing**: Assessing theories or assumptions related to the data.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Numerical and graphical techniques.

#### 5. Data Visualization and Sharing Findings
The final step is to present the findings in an understandable and visually appealing way:

- **Data Visualization**: Creating interactive charts, graphs, and visual representations.
- **Dashboards**: Building dynamic dashboards to allow stakeholders to explore the data and insights.
- **Reporting**: Crafting comprehensive reports or presentations that narrate the findings, implications, and recommendations.

### Conclusion
The data analytics lifecycle is a systematic process that guides analysts from defining the question to sharing the insights. By understanding each stage and applying the appropriate methods and tools, one can derive valuable insights that drive decision-making and strategic planning. Whether dealing with small datasets or big data, the lifecycle provides a structured approach to making sense of information and using it effectively. 

In most of modern projects, an iterative method is used, meaning we can go backwards on any step and ...

## Data Science lifecycle

Following the completion of this week's project, we will embark on an exploration of Machine Learning and the Data Science lifecycle. While we will delve into the details in subsequent sessions, here's a preliminary overview of the primary stages involved.

#### Connecting Data Analytics to Data Science

Data analytics forms a critical part of the broader field of data science. While data analytics focuses on gathering, cleaning, exploring, and visualizing data to derive insights, data science takes it a step further. It encompasses not only those stages but also emphasizes building predictive models.

Let's briefly mention the two new steps in the diagram above.

#### 5. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, or creating new variables (features) from the existing data to enhance the performance of machine learning models. By crafting features that capture underlying patterns or relationships in the data, feature engineering can make models more accurate and interpretable.

#### 6. Predictive Modeling

Predictive modeling, on the other hand, is the process of creating, training, and testing models that can predict future outcomes or classify new observations. It involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, tuning its parameters, and using it to learn from the existing data (training data) so that it can make predictions on unseen data (testing data).

Common predictive modeling techniques include regression (for predicting continuous variables), classification (for categorizing observations into predefined classes), and clustering (for grouping similar observations together).

Predictive modeling relies on the quality of the features, so feature engineering often plays a vital role in building effective models. By combining the right features with the suitable modeling technique, predictive models can provide valuable insights, forecasts, and decision-making tools for various applications, from business and finance to healthcare and technology.

* Note: Deployment is the stage where the developed predictive model is integrated into a production environment, making it accessible to end-users or other systems. This process involves careful planning to ensure that the model functions correctly within the broader ecosystem, and it may include ongoing monitoring to maintain performance and accuracy. Whether it's used in a web application, a business intelligence tool, or another context, successful deployment translates the insights gained from data science into actionable, real-world solutions.
